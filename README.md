###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Complete-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Complete-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Complete-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT
### X-AXIS ASSEMBLY

### SMOOTH ROD
  cylindrical rods, usually made from metal like aluminium or steel.
### BEARING
  bearing refers to a mechanical component used to reduce friction and facilitate smooth movement between two or more parts
### IDLER
  An idler refers to a component that is responsible for guiding and tensioning a filament during the printing process.
### EXTRUDER
  a filament feeding mechanism used in many fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printers
### MOTOR
  used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.
   
### Y-AXIS ASSEMBLY

### Y-AXIS SUPPORTER
   Y-axis supporter refers to a structural component that provides support and stability to the Y-axis motion system.
### HORIZANTAL AND VERTICAL THREADED ROD
   The horizontal threaded rod is often used to control the movement along the X-axis or Y-axis in a 3D printer.
   The vertical threaded rod is used for controlling the movement along the Z-axis in a 3D printer.
### SMOOTH ROD
     cylindrical rods, usually made from metal like aluminium or steel.
### PULLEY
     a small mechanical device used to help guide and position the print head.
### MOTOR
    used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.
### Y-AXIS FRAME
    Y-axis frame refers to the structural component that supports and holds the Y-axis motion system. The Y-axis is one of the three primary axes in a 3D printer, responsible for the movement of the print bed or build plate in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the X-axis.
### Y-AXIS BASE
    Y-base frame refers to the lowermost structural component that forms the foundation and support for the Y-axis motion system. It serves as the base or platform on which the entire Y-axis assembly is built.
    
### Z-AXIS ASSEMBLY

### Z-Axis Rod :
the Z-axis rod refers to a vertical cylindrical shaft that is utilized for linear motion along the Z-axis

### Z-Axis Top Cover :
the Z-axis top cover refers to a component that encloses and protects the upper part of the Z-axis structure.

## Output:

### Name: 
### Register Number:

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on construction of cartesian 3D printer is completed & movement of axis along X, Y, & Z has been studied.
